v2.4.0 released October 29, 2020
 * New Features:
   1. Support for netCDF4 file format reading: CloudCoeff.nc4 and AerosolCoeff.nc4
   2. OpenMP optimization support (see setup/ifort.setup, for example), optimizes profile loop only.  
      - `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4`  is default in .setup files.
   3. Experimental Cloud Coefficient tables (see `fix/CloudCoeff`)
      - Expanded effective radius (10 mm) table to support largest particle sizes in
        binary and netcdf4 formats.
      - *Penn State University contributed tables for closer alignment with common
        cloud microphysical packages: WSM-6, Thompson, GFDL. (netCDF4 format only)
        [not included in v2.4.0-alpha]
   4. Added various regression and unit tests, see `README.md`.
   5. Updated: CMAQ-based (v4.x) Aerosols and Radiance/AOD simulation capability
      - See check_crtm.F90 for how to switch between GOCART (default) and CMAQ
   6. *Finalize CrIS Non-LTE correction validation [not available in alpha release]
   7. Setting the `atmosphere%cloud_fraction=ZERO` now removes cloud contributions to 
      radiance and brightness temperature calculations (but not aerosol contribution).
   8. Improved loop-level performance: 4 to 5 times native improvement by optimizing loops.
   9. Various minor bug fixes relating to uninitialized variables, improper zeroing, etc.
  10. The pyCRTM interface to CRTM is available (github.com/JCSDA/pycrtm)

Github integration, ecbuild build system, and unit test environment
 * New/Updated Coefficients:
   1.  Earth Observing Nanosatellite-Microwave: eon_mw.v1
   2.  Sentinel-3A Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer: slstr_sentinel3a
   3.  Meteosat-11 SEVIRI: seviri_m11
   4.  New coefficient for ABI_G17, and updated IDs from ABI_GR to ABI_G16
   5.  New coefficients for Metop-C sensors: AVHRR3_Metop-C, IASI(b1,b2,b3)_Metop-C,
       IASI300_Metop-C, IASI316_Metop-C, IASI616_Metop-C
   6.  L-Band sensors at 1.413 GHz: SMAP and SMOS (V, H, 3rd, 4th Stokes)
   7.  Tempest-D_cubesat: 5 microwave bands at 87, 164, 173, 178, and 181 GHz
   8.  Updated for a shifted WV band SRF of MI-L_COMS.v2
   8.  Antenna-pattern corrected AMSUA-Metop-C tranmittance coefficients.  
   9.  EON-MW, GOES 17 ABI update for 81K fix, FY4-GIIRS
   10. *JPSS-2 VIIRS, GEOKOMPSAT-2A AMI, Metop-SG-A1 MWS [not available in alpha release]

 * Integrated Bug fixes:
   1. Bug in CRTM_CloudCover_Define.f90, fixing “Intent(in)” to “Intent(in out)” error
      for using gfortran compiler.
   2. Bug in CRTM_CloudCover_Define.f90, when using the “Maximum-Random” scheme to
      calculate Total Cloud Cover.
   3. Bug in ATMS_SnowEM_module, commented out uninitialized (also unused) variables
      and calculations.
   4. Fix a CRTM_AtmOptics_type uninitialized error in CRTM_AtmOptics_Define.f90.
   5. Update the libsrc/make.dependencies file for using make -j option.
   6. Fix a bug in Common_RTSolution.f90, for calculating surface emissivity Jacobian.
   7. Setting the `atmosphere%cloud_fraction=ZERO` now removes cloudy radiances, previously
      it would default to a fully cloudy radiance.  Enables smooth behavior from 1 to 0.
   8. NESDIS_ATMS_SnowEM_Module.f90 fix for bad input brightness temperatures, fails gracefully
      down to an empirical formula.  See code.
   9. OpenMP, ONLY because OpenMP fixed a bug whereby GeometryInfo used settings from one 
      profile in the next profile
      - separated pointer nullification for OpenMP support. (e.g., `NULLIFY(PAFV)`)
  10. CRTM_MW_Ice_SfcOptics.f90, CRTM_MW_Snow_SfcOptics.f90 modified to allows channel-subsetting of 
      microwave radiances: ensures that the correct channels are passing to the NESDIS Ice and Snow 
      emissivity subroutines when only a subset of channels is available


v2.3.0 - released November 21, 2017

 * Made scientific changes to include:
     1. All-Sky radiance simulation under cloud_fraction condition.
     2. Use of all-sky transmittances in FASTEM-X reflection correction.
     3. Improve surface reflectance in radiative transfer calculation for Microwave under
        scattering condition.
     4. Add ATMS SeaIce emissivity module.
     5. Fix the simulation near 3.9 micron by adding solar contribution in ADA_Module.

        AHI_Himawari-9, ABI_G16, VIIRS-JPSS1, ATMS_N20, ATMS_N20-SRF, COWVR, tropics_designed_v1. 

 * Made structure change and bug fix:
     1. Bug fix for the function CRTM_Compute_SfcOptics_AD in CRTM_SfcOptics.f90
     2. Change CRTM_MW_Water_SfcOptics.f90  interface variable dimension.
     3. Remove the channel number in the “all channels” included CRTM coefficient files, 
        e.g. “cris1305_npp” would become simple “cris_npp”.
     4. Remove “ERRMSG” option in the [DE]ALLOCATE functions to fix an error when using
        gfortran compiler.
     5. Change “Data Statement” to “Array Assignment” in 6 Surface Emissivity modules 
        to fix a compile failure when using -e08 in ifort/16.0.+.
     6. Add CloudFraction test in check_crtm.fpp.

 * In this release, there is a new feature for the simulation of all-sky (cloudy)
   radiance, which utilizes Fortran class function, and now CRTM will support the
   new compiler with class function, such as ifort version (14.0+, 15.0+, 16.0+),
   gfortran version (gcc 4.8.5, 4.9, 5.4, 6.4, 7.2), pgi/17.3, ftn/2.3.0.
