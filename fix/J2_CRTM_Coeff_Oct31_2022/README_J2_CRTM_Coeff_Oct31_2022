The J2 CRTM coefficients release is a joint effort from JCSDA and STAR.
Many thanks to Yingtao Ma and Igor Polonsky (STAR), Patrick Stegmann and Benjamin Johnson (UCAR)
for their hard work.

This J2 coefficients package is composed of
  1. J2 ATMS (atms_j2 for box-cart, NOAA/EMC uses box-cart atms coefficients)

  2. J2 CrIS data (cris-fsr_j2, adopted from NOAA-20 cris-fsr_j1 by changing
     sensor_id, because NOAA-20 and J2 CrIS are the same in the
     CRTM calculations.

  3. There are 4 sets CRTM coefficients for J2 VIIRS:
    a) viirs-i_j2    using J2 VIIRS SRF data,
    b) viirs-m_j2    using J2 VIIRS SRF data,
    c) v.viirs-i_j2, using J2 VIIRS SRF data (ODPS algorithm)
    d) v.viirs-m_j2  using J2 VIIRS SRF data (ODPS algorithm)

    NWP centers and EDRs teams haven't used the CRTM to simulate VIIRS visible radiance in operation yet.
    We didn't generate CRTM coefficients for VIIRS DNB because the CRTM can not be
    used for DNB sensor.

  4. These files are both distributed into the typical file structure; AND stored, for copying convenience, in this directory.
     The files here and those inside the typical structure (e.g., TauCoeff/ODPS/Big_Endian/atms_j2.TauCoeff.bin) are 
     Identical.  

  5. OMPS (UV) CRTM coefficients.
     There are 177 FOVs for OMPS nadir maps sensor and their central wavelength for a given
     channel changes with the FOV positions. We have to generate 177 sets coefficients.
     It is difficult for users to use.
     We combines 177 sets coefficients into one set, same for other sensor so that
     users can directly use the CRTM for OMPS NM without changing interface.
     We did the same thing for OMPS nadir profiler sensor.

     These OMPS files will not work with CRTM v2.x, only with v3.0.x

  We very appreciate users' feedback for any abnormaly.

  Thank you very much!
